A simple GUI application to allow the user to see what command prompt commands will work with the FTDI Relay device. 
Advanced and setting features are not added yet, but when compiled using pyinstaller and called using a batch file all commands work as intended.
The installer provivided must be run to install the drivers for the device before the application will function correctly.
